## Problem 2: Minotaurâ€™s Crystal Vase Approach
I believe the guests should choose strategy 3 where the guests are in queue and the guest 
leaving the vaseroom is required to let the nex person in line know that the room 
is available.

The guests should choose this strategy because it is the most fair when compared
to the others. Since guests are in a queue the wlll get their chance to look
at the vase once the previous guest leaves. And if they want to see the vase again,
they are allowed to queue again.

Advantage for this option is its certainty that if all guests want to see the vase
then they can get in line, and all of them will get to see the vase.

Disadvantage for this approach might be that when someone is taking a long time to see the vase, others will have to wait in queue and cannot leave queue untill they have seen the vase. While in other approach they can do other stuff and visit vaseroom when available.
